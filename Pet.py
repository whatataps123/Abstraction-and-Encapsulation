# Joshua Lemuel Z. Centina BS CPE 1-4
# pseudocode
# Write a class named Pet, which should have the following data attributes:
# • _ _name (for the name of a pet)
# • _ _animal_type (for the type of animal that a pet is. Example values are ‘Dog’, ‘Cat’, and ‘Bird’)
# • _ _age (for the pet’s age)
# The Pet class should have an _ _init_ _ method that creates these attributes. It should also have the following methods:
# • set_name()
# This method assigns a value to the _ _name field.
# • set_animal_type()
# This method assigns a value to the _ _animal_type field.
# • set_age()
# This method assigns a value to the _ _age field.
# • get_name()
# This method returns the value of the _ _ name field.
# • get_animal_type()
# This method returns the value of the _ _animal_type field.
# • get_age()
# This method returns the value of the _ _age field.
# Once you have written the class, write a program that creates an object of the class 
# and prompts the user to enter the name, type, and age of his or her pet. This data should be stored as the object’s attributes. 
# Use the object’s accessor methods to retrieve the pet’s name, type, and age and display this data on the screen.
