# pseudocode
# (The Fan class).  Design a class named Fan to represent a fan. The class contains:
# Three constants named SLOW, MEDIUM, and FAST with the values 1, 2, and 3 to denote the fan speed.
# A private int data field named speed that specifies the speed of the fan.
# A private bool data field named on that specifies whether the fan is on (the default is False).
# A private float data field named radius that specifies the radius of the fan.
# A private string data field named color that specifies the color of the fan.
# The accessor(getters)  and mutator(setters)  methods for all four data fields.
# A constructor that creates a fan with the specified speed (default SLOW), radius (default 5), color (default blue), and on (default False).
# Write a test program named TestFan that creates two Fan objects. For the first object, assign the maximum speed, radius 10, color yellow, and turn it on. 
# Assign medium speed, radius 5, color blue, and turn it off for the second object. 
# Display each objectâ€™s speed, radius, color, and on properties.
