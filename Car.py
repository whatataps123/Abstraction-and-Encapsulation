# Joshua Lemuel Z. Centina BS CPE 1-4
# pseudocode
# Write a class named Car that has the following data attributes:
# • _ _year_model (for the car’s year model)
# • _ _make (for the make of the car)
# • _ _speed (for the car’s current speed)
# The Car class should have an _ _init_ _ method that accepts the car’s year model and make as arguments.
# These values should be assigned to the object’s _ _year_model and _ _make data attributes. 
#It should also assign 0 to the _ _speed data attribute.
# The class should also have the following methods:
# • accelerate()
# The accelerate method should add 5 to the speed data attribute each time it is called.
# • brake()
# The brake method should subtract 5 from the speed data attribute each time it is called.
# • get_speed()
# The get_speed method should return the current speed.
# Next, design a program that creates a Car object then calls the accelerate method five times. 
# After each call to the accelerate method, get the current speed of the car and display it. 
# Then call the brake method five times. 
# After each call to the brake method, get the current speed of the car and display it.
